If you're like me and manage multiple Kubernetes clusters using Rancher, you've probably run into situations where you needed to copy the kubeconfig from Rancher to your local machine — whether for debugging with `kubectl` or accessing clusters with `k9s`. Personally, I prefer managing everything through `k9s` and leaving the Rancher UI for developers or support teams who don’t interact with Kubernetes as deeply as I do.

In this post, I’ll show you how I automated this process with a PowerShell script so you can update your local kubeconfig for all clusters in one go.

---

## 💡 Why PowerShell Core?

PowerShell Core works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It’s perfect for cross-platform automation, and it makes interacting with APIs and files super smooth.

---

## ⚙️ What does this script do?

✅ Connects to multiple Rancher environments
✅ Lists all clusters (or filters by name/provider)
✅ Optionally backs up your existing kubeconfig
✅ Merges or recreates kubeconfig automatically
✅ Leaves you ready to `kubectl get pods` everywhere

---

## 🧾 Requirements

* PowerShell Core
* `kubectl` CLI installed and available in your PATH
* Rancher module with helper functions:

  * `Get-RancherClusterAll`
  * `Get-RancherKubeConfig`
  * `Merge-KubeConfigFromRancher`

---

## 🏃‍♂️ Example usage

```powershell
$rancherAccounts = @{
    "dev" = @{
        url = "https://rancher-dev.example.com"
        token = "token-xxxxxx"
    }
    "prod" = @{
        url = "https://rancher-prod.example.com"
        token = "token-yyyyyy"
    }
}

.\rancher-set-kubeconfig.ps1 `
    -rancherAccounts $rancherAccounts `
    -backupExisting `
    -provider "aks" `
    -clusters @("cluster1", "cluster2")
```

✅ Connects to both Rancher environments
✅ Selects clusters named `cluster1` and `cluster2`
✅ Only includes AKS clusters
✅ Backs up your current kubeconfig before updating

---

## 🛠️ How it works

* Takes in a list of Rancher accounts and optional filters (clusters, provider)
* Figures out your OS-specific kubeconfig location
* Backs up or removes existing config (if you want)
* Fetches and merges all selected cluster configs from Rancher

---

## 🚀 Conclusion

This script has saved me hours of boring manual work and avoided nasty copy-paste errors in my kubeconfig.
